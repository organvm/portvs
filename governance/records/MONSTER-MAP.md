# The Monster — VLTIMA MATERIA at a glance

This is the legible face of the institutional census. The machine-readable form is
[`organ-ladder.json`](../organ-ladder.json); `scripts/generate-organ-backlog.py` reads it every feed
beat and points idle fleet capacity at whichever organ is furthest from its next maturity band — so the
whole body builds itself continuously. Regenerate the numbers below from the ladder + `logs/usage.json`.

## The power (assessed 2026-06-23)

| | |
|---|---|
| Fleet capacity (saturated) | **~21,000 work-units / month** across 6 vendor lanes |
| Currently harnessed | **~25–33%** (~5–7k/month) — already 2–3 FTE developers of output |
| Idle headroom | **~14,000–16,000 work-units / month** (67–76%) |
| Fully idle lanes | **codex** (87% efficiency — the best earner), **jules** (94% idle) |
| Binding constraint | **SUPPLY of high-value work, not capacity** |

**The key fact:** the fleet refuses to burn tokens on busywork, so idle capacity is *structurally*
waiting for institution-scale targets. The organs below are that supply. Idle horsepower and unfinished
institutions are the same problem solved from two ends.

Sources: `logs/usage-limits.json`, `logs/usage.json`, `logs/ledger.json`.

## The body — nine organs (civilization's pillars, rebuilt)

Each organ is a **fractal**: it deploys **macro** (a platform anyone can hold) and **micro** (Anthony's
own instance). Maturity = how close it is to a self-running institution.

| # | Pillar | Organ | Maturity | Stage | Rivals | First artifact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Legal** | Legal Organism | 20% | scaffold | a top-tier litigation firm (the Cochran standard) | case-posture brief + evidence index → **deck for Micah** |
| 2 | **Financial** | Financial Office | 30% | building | a billionaire's family office (Musk/Bezos-tier) | personal balance-sheet + cashflow + payrail disbursement |
| 3 | **Education** | Education Organism | 70% | maturing | an elite academy + the alt-ed billion-$ gap | formalized 5-primitive kernel + alt-ed thesis brief |
| 4 | **Media** | Carrier-Wave Media | 40% | building | a cross-platform media empire (Bowie/Tarantino of systems) | fire essay→kerygma on ONE real event |
| 5 | **Governance** | Aerarium / Cvrsvs Honorvm | 50% | building | a constitutional state / foundation governance | operationalize one cvrsvs-honorvm rule as a validator |
| 6 | **Consulting** | Sovereign Systems | 60% | maturing | a boutique agency / consultancy | repeatable intake→delivery autonomic playbook |
| 7 | **Artist** | A-MAVS-OLEVM (Poiesis) | 70% | maturing | a living museum / studio (9-chamber Pantheon) | fill under-populated chambers with real work |
| 8 | **Social** | Koinonia | 5% | scaffold | a civic institution + relationship support | charter + 5-primitive map + first slice |
| 9 | **Health** | Health / Body | 15% | scaffold | a concierge medical / recovery team | KERNEL + CHARTER + recovery/access protocol |

**The 5-primitive kernel** (every organ, domain-neutral): `Member · Mandate · Standing · Standard ·
Governance`. Generic + nameless underneath, his instance on top — never hardcoded to one person.

## How it builds itself

1. `organ-ladder.json` ranks the organs + their next-build levers (the census, machine-readable).
2. `generate-organ-backlog.py` (feed beat, default-ON, floor-gated, lockless) emits bounded organ-build
   tasks toward each organ's next band — one per pillar until the floor (which the full-tank accelerator
   lifts when capacity is idle).
3. The conductor routes them across the idle lanes; the fleet authors institutional artifacts into
   `organs/<pillar>/` and opens PRs.
4. As slices land, maturity in the ladder ticks up; mature (≥90%) organs stop generating build work.

The leak it closes: the fleet was generating only build-out/test-coverage busywork, so the best earner
lanes sat idle. Now the same idle capacity compounds into institutional weight.

## His hand only (irreducible — surfaced, not nagged)

- **card-0186 Santander fraud hold** — the whole stack's billing rides on it (one call clears it).
- **Financial identity** — receiving real money (bank/KYC) is genuinely his.
- **The send / the signature** — I draft; he sends/signs (reversible-only).
- **Institutional logins** — D2L (education); privileged/filing acts with Micah (legal).

Everything buildable is the fleet's, and it proceeds without asking.
