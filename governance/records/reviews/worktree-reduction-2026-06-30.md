# Worktree Reduction Receipt - 2026-06-30

Generated: `2026-06-30T16:51:39Z`

This receipt records the direct-session reduction pass requested before photos sorting and
creative-lane work. It does not claim unrelated queue tasks and does not mutate `tasks.yaml`.

## Preconditions

- `git push origin main` advanced `organvm/limen` `main` to `9f8be9834f75eba24572f4804a672faf89eb2b55`.
- `tasks.yaml` already had async-reservation edits before this pass and was intentionally left
  unstaged.
- `studium/ledger/studium-2026-06-30.md` was intentionally left separate and unstaged.
- `python3 scripts/validate-task-board.py` reported `Task board statuses valid (1533 tasks)`.
- `python3 scripts/verify-dispatch.py --quiet` exited 0.

## Removed Roots

The following roots are safe to remove in this pass because they are remote-merged,
remote-superseded, or documented disposable residue:

| Root | Class | Receipt |
|---|---|---|
| `rev-organvm-public-record-data-scrapper-revenue-readiness-0623-023f` | remote-merged / patch-equivalent | PR `organvm/public-record-data-scrapper#328` is `MERGED`, head `3af406915ec3a3c67f0843f963cb6a3658bcc9d9` matches the local worktree, and `git cherry origin/main HEAD` reports the local commit as patch-equivalent. |
| `cifix-organvm-i-theoria-hierarchia-mundi-3145` | remote-superseded | `docs/worktree-preservation-receipts.json` records `superseded_on_origin_main`; current `origin/main` includes broader loader, CLI, and smoke-test coverage. |
| `gen-organvm-i-theoria-sovereign--ground-ci-green-0620-0f38` | documented generated-results residue | `docs/worktree-preservation-receipts.json` records private patch SHA-256 `92dc514490c7bbf3c6a14eb3889656563d070a23af55af3d64f2a16999d63bc9`; current local deltas are only the 11 `structure-tests/results/*.json` snapshots. |
| `gen-organvm-the-invisible-ledger-ci-green-0625-e3c2` | documented non-source residue | Empty `dist/` directory only; recorded as `empty_generated_residue`. |
| `rev-organvm-the-invisible-ledger-revenue-readiness-0623-bd8b` | documented non-source residue | `.vite/deps` cache metadata only; recorded as `cache_only_residue`. |
| `gen-organvm-limen-ci-green-0622-9c4d` | disposable non-git log shell | Contains only `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.md` and `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.json`. |
| `gen-organvm-limen-security-0622-88e5` | disposable non-git log shell | Contains only `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.md` and `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.json`. |
| `org-consulting-organ-face-0630-0073` | disposable non-git log shell | Contains only `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.md` and `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.json`. |
| `org-education-organ-face-0630-58c0` | disposable non-git log shell | Contains only `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.md` and `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.json`. |
| `org-governance-organ-deepen-0630-acad` | disposable non-git log shell | Contains only `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.md` and `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.json`. |
| `org-media-organ-deepen-0630-43a4` | disposable non-git log shell | Contains only `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.md` and `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.json`. |
| `triptych-media-offload-20260629` | collapsed Portvs worktree | Pushed `work/triptych-media-offload-20260629` to `b7a5fc2`, fast-forwarded and pushed `work/triptych-story` to the same commit, then removed the redundant local checkout. |

## Kept Roots

- Active `<6h` and `<24h` daemon/repair/photo roots were kept for harvest.
- Portvs `triptych-story` was kept as the active creative surface after absorbing
  `triptych-media-offload-20260629`.
- `photos-universe-20260629-182431` was kept as the active photos lane.
- Owner-blocker and active roots outside the explicit removals were kept.

## PR Receipts Opened

Clean pushed branches that were not merged to default were converted into draft PR receipts instead
of staying as invisible local worktree debt. Missing remote heads were pushed before PR creation
when needed.

| Root | PR |
|---|---|
| `triptych-story` | `https://github.com/organvm/portvs/pull/1` |
| `maddie-boundary-20260629` | `https://github.com/organvm/relationship-pipeline/pull/11` |
| `universal-entry-20260629` | `https://github.com/organvm/domus-genoma/pull/161` |
| `mirror-mirror` | `https://github.com/organvm/mirror-mirror/pull/96` |
| `the-invisible-ledger` | `https://github.com/organvm/the-invisible-ledger/pull/79` |
| `warp-agent-routing-20260629` | `https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/495` |
| `limen-main-trench-20260628` | `https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/493` |
| `limen-network-substrate-20260628` | `https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/494` |

`scripts/worktree-pr-receipts.py` now makes this loop repeatable: it scans debt roots, skips dirty
or non-candidate roots, pushes a missing remote head under `--apply`, opens a draft PR, and records
per-root errors without stopping the rest of the loop.

## Continuation Pass

After the reduction loop reached zero debt, the active lanes continued instead of stopping:

- Photos Universe duplicate proof advanced to `80` processed groups with `79` hash-proven
  duplicate groups and `1` hash-rejected candidate group. Public receipt:
  `docs/photos-universe-duplicate-proof-2026-06-29.json` on
  `work/photos-universe-20260629-182431` at `d45b030`.
- Portvs triptych ingested that aggregate receipt through a generated proxy only:
  `incubator/triptych-video-canon/PHOTOS_UNIVERSE_PROXY.md` and
  `photos_universe_proxy.py` on `work/triptych-story` at `7325b8b`.
- The Portvs PR receipt stayed open at `https://github.com/organvm/portvs/pull/1`; Limen's
  preservation receipt was refreshed to the updated PR head.

## Post-Reduction Gates

Run after removal:

- `python3 scripts/worktree-debt.py --json`
- `python3 scripts/validate-task-board.py`
- `python3 scripts/verify-dispatch.py --quiet`

Observed after-state:

- Worktree debt: `0` debt-bearing roots / `34` total roots, cap `12`.
- `/Users/4jp/Workspace/.limen-worktrees`: `865M`.
- Remaining receipt classes: `remote-pr-open=11`, `owner-blocker=2`, `active(<24h)=10`,
  `active(<6h)=11`.
- Active roots created or updated by the live fleet during this pass were kept for harvest.
