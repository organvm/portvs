# Worktree Lifecycle Inventory - 2026-06-27

This inventory records the kept-safe roots under `/Users/4jp/Workspace/.limen-worktrees`.
No directory was deleted or removed during this pass.

The live reconciliation surface is
[`docs/worktree-lifecycle-ledger.md`](../worktree-lifecycle-ledger.md). This dated file is the
snapshot from the first audit; use the ledger for current disposition, origin-receipt gaps, and
drain order.

Post-audit update: the background reaper later reclaimed the two content-preserved roots
`gen-organvm-mirror-mirror-security-0622-c552` and
`gen-organvm-the-invisible-ledger-security-0622-d8f8` at `2026-06-27T13:05:49Z`.
Both had already been classified as patch-equivalent to default, so no unique source was lost.
Policy update 2026-06-29: future automated drain runs apply safe reclaims by default
(`LIMEN_RECLAIM_APPLY=1`). Set `LIMEN_RECLAIM_APPLY=0` for preview-only operation.

Post-audit update: `bld-universal-mail--automation-readme-9031` was rebased to
current `origin/main`, committed as `29f6b4b`, pushed, and preserved as draft PR
[#108](https://github.com/organvm/universal-mail--automation/pull/108). It is no
longer dirty local-only work, though it remains lifecycle debt until merged or
explicitly superseded.

Post-audit update: `bld-media-ark-tests-2698` was rebased to current
`origin/main`, the useful dirty test draft was ported into the current test
module, platform test-contract gaps were fixed, and the result was preserved as
draft PR [#50](https://github.com/organvm/media-ark/pull/50) at `b7509dc`.

Post-audit update: `bld-mirror-mirror-harden-350f` was rebased to current
`origin/main`, the stale draft PR branch was replaced with an explicit
force-with-lease from `3d822c6` to `f44da8e`, and the resolved webhook
hardening was preserved as draft PR
[#67](https://github.com/organvm/mirror-mirror/pull/67). The PR is clean and
GitHub CI passed; the local root is no longer dirty local-only work, though it
remains lifecycle debt until merged or explicitly superseded.

Reclaim policy after this audit: a root is reapable only when it is clean, idle, and its
content is preserved on the remote default branch. Preservation can be exact SHA reachability
or `git cherry <default> HEAD` patch equivalence after squash/rebase. Dirty work,
unique-unpushed commits, open/unmerged branches, active roots, and non-Git residue stay visible.

## Summary

- 21 roots inspected.
- 0 roots reclaimed.
- 12 dirty roots: local file changes need review, commit, PR, or explicit discard-after-preserve.
- 4 unique-unpushed roots: local commits need push/PR or absorption into an existing branch.
- 2 non-Git roots: filesystem residue needs classification before any cleanup.
- 1 active root: recently touched after rebase/classification; re-check after the idle grace window.
- 2 content-preserved roots: dry-run says they are reapable, but no directory was removed in this pass.

## Invariant

Prompt-started work is not garbage. A local root exits this inventory only through a visible
lifecycle event: merged to the default branch, moved into a tracked PR/task, or explicitly
classified with preserved evidence.
