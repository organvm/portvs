# Session Screenshot Intake - 2026-06-27

Generated: `2026-06-27T18:31:00Z`

## Scope

This receipt covers the 14 Claude Code and Codex app screenshots pasted into the active Limen
session on 2026-06-27. The screenshots are not the canonical corpus; they are UI evidence that the
Claude and Codex app histories contain older work starts that must enter the same lifecycle as
worktrees, PRs, tasks, and ledgers.

## Private Absorption

- Raw screenshots were copied into the ignored private cartridge:
  `./.limen-private/session-corpus/screenshots/2026-06-27/`.
- The private batch contains `14` PNG artifacts plus `manifest.sha256`.
- `docs/session-corpus-ledger.md` now records the private screenshot batch count.
- The tracked ledger records only hashes, source app, visible work families, and lifecycle routing.

## Canonical Evidence

- `docs/session-corpus-ledger.md` indexes `9719` local Claude/Codex/session files, `2.1 GiB`, with
  raw objects materialized in `.limen-private/session-corpus/`.
- `docs/prompt-lifecycle-ledger.md` hashes `92656` prompt-like user events from `9481` app/session
  files into the private lifecycle index.
- The private lifecycle index includes `2463` local session/source files older than 2026-06-20:
  `1628` Claude project files, `387` Codex session files, `352` Claude file-history files,
  `95` Claude task files, and `1` Codex attachment.
- Local search confirms that screenshot-visible loop families such as `convergence organ` are
  present in the local app stores; raw matching paths remain private.

## Screenshot Receipts

| Image | App | SHA-256 Prefix | Visible Work Families | Lifecycle Route |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Claude Code | `deee6a7f53d0` | needs-input sessions, PR queue, technical debt, handoff, revenue check | Absorbed into prompt lifecycle; triage via drain queue, not deletion |
| 2 | Claude Code | `e4063cebbf24` | technical debt, GitHub issue review, TypeScript checks, remote sandbox | Classify as repeated engineering loop; route to repo/PR owner |
| 3 | Claude Code | `a585b86de36c` | GitHub issue review, local worktree slugs, metadata audit, pulse restore | Map local session slugs to `.limen-worktrees` before action |
| 4 | Claude Code | `a1bb607c1b72` | worktree containerization, open-code parsing, Codex doctor, past-week scan | Feed into `codex-quicken.py` lifecycle routing |
| 5 | Claude Code | `e2b15bc5ce19` | code review, knowledge graph, Cloudflare/Terraform migrations | Route by owning repo; park auth/provider issues |
| 6 | Claude Code | `f7dfd4ac9b25` | review suggestions, inquiry artifact, Gemini review, relay persistence | Preserve artifacts first; dispatch only bounded non-auth packets |
| 7 | Claude Code | `7ac5dd960bde` | inventory closeout, archive closeout, open priorities, old session digest | Treat as lifecycle/control-plane work, not source cleanup |
| 8 | Claude Code | `405afe613f07` | config investigation, autonomous architecture, git push hangs, Orion review | Park login/secrets; route push/config fixes to owner records |
| 9 | Claude Code | `0dfbded4d112` | resume skill restoration, project status, corpus extraction, pending items | Deduplicate into corpus/convergence and worktree-drain queues |
| 10 | Codex app | `1fb8b7c88d4a` | `cli`, `my-knowledge-base`, scraper, portfolio, chess product surfaces | Indexed through Codex sessions/history; route by project |
| 11 | Codex app | `d21e405df4d7` | repeated convergence-organ sessions, AGENTS generation, game critique | Repetition is signal; cluster as convergence/canonicalization loop |
| 12 | Codex app | `9ef5f381fed1` | expanded repeated convergence-organ sessions, `cli`, knowledge projects | Same cluster as image 11; preserve raw in private corpus |
| 13 | Codex app | `c4acf4e571aa` | `limen` project hotkey sessions, review-all-work, active meta-goal | Current session is the canonical continuation point |
| 14 | Codex app | `0d850fe9e08f` | my-knowledge-base, public-record scraper, portfolio, chess surfaces | Fold product-surface work into drain queue after owner receipts |

## Roadblocks And Potholes

- The screenshots show app UI titles, not enough source truth to close work directly.
- Raw screenshot content is personal session material and stays in `.limen-private/`.
- Repeated titles are not noise: `technical debt`, `open GitHub issues review`, and `convergence
  organ` are loop families that need classifiers and owner receipts.
- Login, credential, key, token, and password issues are parked into the credential workstream unless
  a queue item explicitly requires them.
- No unique work should be deleted, closed as not planned, or forgotten because it is stale or
  inconvenient.
